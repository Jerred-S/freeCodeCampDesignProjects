# Introduction

This directory contains the final design projects of each certification module.

## Responsive Web Design

Projects (pages, really) in here demonstrate use of Basic HTML and HTML5, Basic CSS, Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid. The requirement of these projects are very specific and must pass a number of automated acceptance tests (accessible through each page's menu button, top left corner). Consequently, some of them have bizarre looking content. One highlight is my reuse of style.css giving three of the five pages a consistent feel. 

The exercises' instructions can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects and my solutions are in the `Responsive Web Design` directory here. When viewing these pages, it would be best to download the entire directory's content from Githbub; viewing them on Github directly probably won't work well.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

These projects (code snippets) demonstrate the use of essential JavaScript principles: Basic JavaScript, ES6, Regular Expressions, Debugging, Basic Data Structures, Basic Algorithm Scripting, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Intermediate Algorithm Scripting, and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects. 

The exercises' instructions can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/ and my solutions are in the `JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification` directory here.
