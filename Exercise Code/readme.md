# Introduction
Code in this directory & children contains my solutions to the hundreds of lessens & challenges on https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ . Some of these solutions are not particularly clean, elegant, or efficient; my goal is to use my time as efficiently as possible to cover the greatest amount of learning material. However, the solutions have been retained either because they have a novel algorithm or simply to demonstrate (above & beyond the [certifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jerred) ) that I know this stuff.

## `javascript_algorithms_and_data_structures`
The solutions in this directory are for the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jerred/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures). Topics covered are 

- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Regular Expressions
- Debugging
- Basic Data Structures
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Object Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

## `front_end_libraries_certification`
The solutions in this directory are for the *Front End Libraries Certification*, which I am still learning. Topics that will be covered are 

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Sass
- React
- Redux
- React and Redux
- Front End Libraries Projects
